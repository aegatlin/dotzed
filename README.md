# dotzed

These are my zed configuration files. On MacOS they are by default located in
`~/.config/zed`.

## Installation

To a first approximation you need to do something like this from within
`~/.config/zed` to get started.

```sh
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:aegatlin/dotzed.git
git pull
```
